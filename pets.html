			<h2>Animal Empath</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Kristy. I am a Vet Tech student at Ashworth College and a community volunteer with a local animal rescue. I love dogs, cats, small critters and all animals really! I have a very good rapport with animals and am kind, compassionate, patient and trustworthy. Animals are my passion in life and I look forward to providing you and your companions with the services you need! I currently am guardian to a rescue cat and 2 rescue guinea pigs. I grew up around a stray dog and also spent my young adulthood in the company of a Black Lab/Dalmatian Rescue. I have also been guardian to feral cats in the past. I am familiar with canine separation anxiety and looking to provide you and your furry friend with the ultimate services in companionship.

Kristy is a volunteer for my 501c3 non-profit guinea pig rescue called Ocean State Guinea Pig Rescue. Kristy is extremely knowledgeable about all different types of animals. She is very accommodating, compassionate, reliable, caring, and trustworthy. Kristyâ€™s personality is very warm and happy. You can tell by her personality that she loves animals. I trust her completely with taking care of my rescued guinea pigs and you can definitely trust her to take very good care of your animals. I am very lucky to have met Kristy and I highly recommend her!</p>
